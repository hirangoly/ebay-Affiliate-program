ebay-Affiliate-program
======================
Make money by displaying ebay products to your website and get paid if any user click/buy/bid on any of product through your website.

basic steps: 
* Register to http://developer.ebay.com/ to get your own API key. 
* Write a php script to return ebay product results based on keywords passed as input parameter. script is finding.php
* Use that script in your application by calling php script in above step in iframe. script is sidebar.php
(please refer Guide-ebayAPI-ThruPHP.doc for more detail about calling of ebay API in php)

In my case, I dispalyed ebay products in my wordpress website. Products will be displayed based on the blog content or the keywords stored for the content. E.g If you are reading topic "Honda Accord Survey" then you will be able to see top 5 rated ebay products related to Honda Accord.
